# Medication Tracker: History View Component Refactor

**Date**: October 5, 2025

## Summary

Extracted the medication### 6. Undo Functionality

- **Added undo buttons** for "Taken" and "Skipped" medication logs
- **Reset to pending**: Clicking undo resets the log status back to "pending"
- **Clears metadata**: Also clears actualTime and notes when undoing
- **Visual feedback**: Shows success toast when undo is performed
- **Limited scope**: Only available for taken/skipped logs (missed logs remain as-is for accuracy)ory view from the main medication tracker page into its own component (`HistoryView.svelte`) and enhanced it to group medications by date with daily statistics.

## Changes Made

### New Component Created

**`src/routes/apps/(app)/medication-tracker/HistoryView.svelte`**

A dedicated component for displaying medication history with the following features:

#### Key Features

1. **Date-based Grouping**

   - Groups all medication logs by date (day level)
   - Sorts dates in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
   - Sorts medications within each day by scheduled time

2. **Daily Headers**

   - Shows relative date labels: "Today", "Yesterday", or formatted date
   - Displays total medications scheduled for that day
   - Shows daily adherence percentage with color coding
   - Sticky positioning for easy navigation

3. **Daily Statistics Summary**

   - Visual grid showing:
     - Taken medications (green)
     - Skipped medications (yellow)
     - Missed medications (red)
     - Pending medications (gray)
   - Only displays categories with values > 0

4. **Medication Cards**

   - Color-coded indicator for each medication
   - Medication name and dosage
   - Scheduled time with clock icon
   - Status badge (Taken, Skipped, Missed, Pending)
   - Actual time taken if different from scheduled
   - Optional notes display

5. **Empty State**
   - Friendly message when no history exists yet
   - Clock icon for visual clarity

#### Props

```typescript
{
  session: TreatmentSession;      // Current treatment session
  logs: MedicationLog[];          // All medication logs for the session
  getMedication: (id: string) => Medication | undefined;  // Helper function
}
```

#### Computed Values

- `groupedLogs`: Groups and sorts all logs by date using `$derived.by()`
- Daily stats: Calculated on-the-fly for each day's logs

### Updates to Main Page

**`src/routes/apps/(app)/medication-tracker/+page.svelte`**

1. Added import for `HistoryView` component
2. Replaced inline history view code with component usage:
   ```svelte
   <HistoryView
   	session={activeSession}
   	logs={medState.getLogsForSession(activeSession.id)}
   	{getMedication}
   />
   ```

## Benefits

### Code Organization

- **Separation of Concerns**: History view logic isolated from main page
- **Reusability**: Component can be reused in other contexts
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify history view without affecting main page

### User Experience

- **Better Organization**: Medications grouped by day for easy scanning
- **Daily Context**: See what medications are scheduled for each day
- **Quick Stats**: At-a-glance adherence rate for each day
- **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded status and daily summaries
- **Error Recovery**: Undo functionality for accidental status changes

### Data Structure

- Properly utilizes the medication session's date range
- Shows complete daily schedule for the duration of treatment
- Helps users see patterns in their medication schedule

## Implementation Details

### Date Grouping Algorithm

1. Create a Map with date keys (YYYY-MM-DD format)
2. Group all logs under their respective dates
3. Sort dates in descending order (newest first)
4. Sort medications within each day by scheduled time (ascending)

### Adherence Calculation

- **Green (≥90%)**: Excellent adherence
- **Yellow (70-89%)**: Good adherence
- **Red (<70%)**: Needs improvement

### Responsive Design

- Sticky date headers for easy navigation when scrolling
- Mobile-friendly layout with appropriate spacing
- Badges show full text on desktop, icon-only on mobile

## Testing

Verified with `bun check`:

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No Svelte compilation errors
- ✅ Proper Svelte 5 runes usage ($derived.by(), $props())

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Date Range Filtering**: Allow users to filter by date range
2. **Export Functionality**: Export daily schedules to PDF/CSV
3. **Search**: Search medications within history
4. **Calendar View**: Integrate with a calendar view
5. **Daily Notes**: Add notes for entire days
6. **Trends**: Show adherence trends over time in history view

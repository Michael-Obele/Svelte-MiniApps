## About

Svelte MiniApps offers tools to streamline specific tasks. Whether converting units, generating passwords, or managing to-do lists, there's a mini-app to simplify your day.

## Built for Efficiency

Svelte MiniApps is a single Progressive Web App (PWA) featuring a collection of tools built for various web users. It enhances productivity and organization with the following features:

- **Versatile Tools:** Designed for different needs and difficulty levels.
- **Web-Based:** Built specifically for web users.
- **High Performance:** Fast and efficient, now with Svelte 5.
- **Installable:** Can be added to your device for quick access.
- **Offline Capability:** Works offline once accessed.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm (or another package manager).
- PostgreSQL database (for production)

**Explore the Mini-Apps:**
Fork the repository, clone your fork, and run the development server to explore the mini-apps.

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Svelte-MiniApps.git
cd Svelte-MiniApps
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

4. Create a new branch for your contribution:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

**Note:** The Vite development server runs on port **5178** instead of the traditional **5173**. Make sure to access your app at `http://localhost:5178`.

**Database Setup:**
The project uses Prisma ORM for database management. Follow these steps to set up your database:

1. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the DATABASE_URL in your .env file:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
```

3. Initialize your database:

```bash
npx prisma generate  # Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma db push   # Push schema changes to database
```

For development, you can use Prisma Studio to manage your data:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

###### **Important**: For production environments, it's recommended to switch your Prisma data source provider from SQLite to PostgreSQL or MySQL.

     The project uses Prisma ORM for database management. Prisma provides type-safe database access with great developer experience.

## App Usage Tracking

Svelte MiniApps now includes an app usage tracking feature that:

- Automatically tracks which apps you use most frequently
- Records when you last used each app
- Displays your favorite apps in your profile based on usage
- Calculates a streak based on your daily app usage

### How to Implement Usage Tracking in Your App

To add usage tracking to your app, simply include the `AppTracker` component in your app's layout:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import AppTracker from '$lib/components/AppTracker.svelte';
  
  // Replace with your app's link/identifier
  const appLink = 'your-app-link';
</script>

<!-- Include this component to track app usage -->
<AppTracker appLink={appLink} />

<!-- Your app content -->
<div>
  <!-- App content here -->
</div>
```

This will automatically increment the usage count for your app each time a user visits it.

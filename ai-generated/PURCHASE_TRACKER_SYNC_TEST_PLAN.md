## Expected Behavior Summary

### Automatic Sync

- âœ… Authenticated users always get server data on page load
- âœ… Local storage updates with server data
- âœ… No unsaved changes flag after sync
- âœ… Console logs sync operations

### Manual Refresh

- âœ… Button visible only for authenticated users
- âœ… Shows loading state during operation
- âœ… Warns about unsaved changes
- âœ… Provides success/error feedback
- âœ… Updates local state with fresh server data

### Edge Cases

- âœ… Handles unauthenticated users gracefully
- âœ… Prevents data loss with confirmation dialogs
- âœ… Handles network errors with user feedback
- âœ… Disables button during operation
- âœ… Works with empty datasets

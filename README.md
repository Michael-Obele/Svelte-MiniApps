## About

Svelte MiniApps offers tools to streamline specific tasks. Whether converting units, generating passwords, or managing to-do lists, there's a mini-app to simplify your day.

## Built for Efficiency

Svelte MiniApps is a single Progressive Web App (PWA) featuring a collection of tools built for various web users. It enhances productivity and organization with the following features:

- **Versatile Tools:** Designed for different needs and difficulty levels.
- **Web-Based:** Built specifically for web users.
- **High Performance:** Fast and efficient, now with Svelte 5.
- **Installable:** Can be added to your device for quick access.
- **Offline Capability:** Works offline once accessed.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js and npm (or another package manager).
- PostgreSQL database (for production)

**Database Setup:**
The project uses Prisma ORM for database management. Follow these steps to set up your database:

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the DATABASE_URL in your .env file:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
```

3. Initialize your database:
```bash
npx prisma generate  # Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma db push   # Push schema changes to database
```

For development, you can use Prisma Studio to manage your data:
```bash
npm run db:studio
```

**Explore the Mini-Apps:**
Clone the repository and run the development server to explore the mini-apps.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Michael-Obele/Svelte-MiniApps.git
cd Svelte-MiniApps
bun install
bun run dev
```

**Note:** The Vite development server runs on port **5178** instead of the traditional **5173**. Make sure to access your app at `http://localhost:5178`.

###### **Important**: For production environments, it's recommended to switch your Prisma data source provider from SQLite to PostgreSQL or MySQL.

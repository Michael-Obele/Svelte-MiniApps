## Getting Started üèÅ

**Prerequisites:**

- PostgreSQL database (for production)

**Explore the Mini-Apps:**

To explore the Mini-Apps, fork the repository, clone your fork, and run the development server.

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Svelte-MiniApps.git
    cd Svelte-MiniApps
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

4.  **Create a new branch** for your contribution:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

**Note:** The Vite development server runs on port **5178** instead of the traditional **5173**. Access your app at `http://localhost:5178`.

### Database Setup:

The project uses Prisma ORM for database management. Follow these steps to set up your database:

1.  **Copy the example environment file:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Update the DATABASE_URL** in your `.env` file:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
    ```

3.  **Initialize your database:**

    ```bash
    npx prisma generate  # Generate Prisma Client
    npx prisma db push   # Push schema changes to database
    ```

For development, you can use Prisma Studio to manage your data:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

**Important**: The project has moved from SQLite to PostgreSQL for improved scalability and performance. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and configured locally.

        <li>Once installed, open the PostgreSQL shell or a GUI tool like pgAdmin.</li>
        <li>Create a new database:
            <pre><code>CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Update your <code>.env</code> file with the connection string:
            <pre><code>DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/mydatabase"</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Test the connection by running:

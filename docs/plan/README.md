# Project Plan for Svelte-MiniApps

This folder contains planning documents and lightweight specification files for future features and content related to the Svelte-MiniApps project.

Files:

- `timeline.md` — planned milestones and tentative dates for major features (mobile/desktop apps, releases).
- `announcements.md` — announcement drafts and a plan for an announcements page.
- `playground.md` — design notes for a playground (interactive vs stepper) and MVP plan.
- `walkthroughs.md` — structure and index for app-by-app walkthroughs, broken into chunks.

Use this folder to track roadmap items, communication drafts, and walkthrough drafts before implementing UI pages.

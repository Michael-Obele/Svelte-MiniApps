# GitHub Contribution Tracker - Loading Issue Fix

## The Problem

The page was stuck showing a loading state even though:

- API logs showed successful data fetch (842 contributions)
- Computed stats were being calculated
- Console showed contradictory states: `loading: true` but data available

## The Root Cause

**Wrapping the remote query function in `$derived` caused it to create new query objects repeatedly.**

### What Was Wrong

```svelte
// ❌ INCORRECT - Creates new query objects const username = $derived(page.params.user); const year
= $derived(page.params.year); const contributionData = $derived(getContributionData({(username,
year)}));
```

When `$derived` re-evaluated:

1. It called `getContributionData()` again
2. Created a NEW query object (starts with `loading: true`)
3. Old query had completed with data
4. But UI checked the NEW query's loading state
5. Result: Stuck at `loading: true` while data existed in old query

## The Fix

**Remove `$derived` wrapper and call the query directly:**

```svelte
// ✅ CORRECT - Single query object, reactive properties const username = page.params.user; const
year = page.params.year; const contributionData = getContributionData({(username, year)});
```

## Why This Works

### 1. Query Caching

SvelteKit caches queries by arguments:

```javascript
// These return the SAME query object:
const q1 = getContributionData({ username: 'octocat', year: '2024' });
const q2 = getContributionData({ username: 'octocat', year: '2024' });
console.log(q1 === q2); // true
```

### 2. Component Remounting

When route params change:

- User navigates: `/octocat/2024` → `/torvalds/2025`
- SvelteKit remounts the component
- New `username` and `year` values captured
- New query created with new arguments
- **No `$derived` needed** to track param changes

### 3. Reactive Query Properties

The query object itself has reactive properties:

```javascript
const query = getContributionData({ username, year });

// These are reactive and trigger re-renders:
query.loading; // true → false when loaded
query.error; // undefined → error object if fails
query.current; // undefined → data when loaded
```

## Key Learnings

### ❌ Don't Do This

```svelte
// Creates new query objects unnecessarily const query = $derived(getQueryFunction(args));
```

### ✅ Do This Instead

```svelte
// Call once, let query properties be reactive const query = getQueryFunction(args);
```

### When to Use `$derived` with Queries

Only when you need to transform the query result:

```svelte
const query = getContributionData({(username, year)}); // ✅ Derive computed values from query data
const totalCommits = $derived( query.current?.stats?.totalCommitContributions ?? 0 );
```

## Testing

Run the dev server and navigate to a user's contribution page:

```bash
bun dev
# Visit: http://localhost:5178/apps/github-contribution-tracker/octocat/2024
```

Watch the console logs:

```
[GitHub API] ========== Starting data fetch ==========
[GitHub API] ✓ GraphQL client created successfully
[Component] Query state: { loading: true, hasCurrent: false }
[GitHub API] ✓ FETCH COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
[Component] Query state: { loading: false, hasCurrent: true }
[Component] Stats computed successfully: { totalContributions: 842 }
```

## Files Modified

- `src/routes/apps/(app)/github-contribution-tracker/[user]/[year]/+page.svelte`

  - Removed `$derived` wrapper from query call
  - Simplified param handling
  - Enhanced debug logging

- `src/lib/remote/data.remote.ts`
  - Already had comprehensive logging from previous session

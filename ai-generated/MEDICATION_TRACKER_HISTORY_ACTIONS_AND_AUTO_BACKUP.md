# Medication Tracker: History Actions & Auto-Backup Features

**Date**: October 5, 2025

## Summary

Added two major features to the Medication Tracker:

1. **History Tab Actions**: Ability to mark medications as taken or skipped from past days in the history view
2. **Auto-Backup**: Automatic backup functionality that saves data to the server 15 seconds after changes for logged-in users

## Feature 1: Mark Medications from History

### Problem Solved

Users couldn't mark medications from previous days (yesterday, days before) if they forgot to log them in real-time. The only way to mark medications was in the "Today" tab, which only showed current day's medications.

### Solution

Added action buttons to pending medications in the History view, allowing users to retroactively mark medications from any past day.

### Implementation Details

#### HistoryView Component Updates

**New Props:**

```typescript
onMarkTaken?: (logId: string) => void;
onMarkSkipped?: (logId: string, notes?: string) => void;
```

**New State:**

- `showSkipDialog`: Controls skip medication dialog visibility
- `skipNotes`: Stores optional notes when skipping
- `currentLog`: Tracks which log is being skipped

**UI Changes:**

- Added "Taken" and "Skip" buttons next to pending medications in history
- Buttons only appear when callbacks are provided (from parent component)
- Skip button opens dialog for optional notes
- Buttons use same styling as TodayTracker for consistency

**Skip Dialog:**

- Reused dialog component from TodayTracker
- Allows optional notes when skipping medications
- Clean, accessible UI with textarea input

### User Experience

**Before:**

- Users could only mark today's medications
- Missed medications from previous days stayed as "Pending" forever
- No way to retroactively log forgotten medications

**After:**

- Users can mark any pending medication from any day
- Navigate to History tab → find past medication → mark as taken/skipped
- Helps maintain accurate adherence records
- Useful for catching up on forgotten entries

### Use Cases

1. **Forgot to log yesterday**: User can mark yesterday's medications as taken/skipped
2. **Batch logging**: User took medications but forgot to log them for several days
3. **Correcting records**: User wants to update their history for accuracy
4. **Adherence tracking**: Ensures complete historical data for statistics

## Feature 2: Auto-Backup for Logged-In Users

### Problem Solved

Users had to manually click the "Backup" button to save their data to the server. This could lead to data loss if they forgot to backup before closing the browser or switching devices.

### Solution

Implemented automatic backup that triggers 15 seconds after any data change for authenticated users.

### Implementation Details

#### New State Variables

```typescript
let autoBackupTimer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null = null;
```

#### Auto-Backup Logic

**`scheduleAutoBackup()` Function:**

- Clears any existing timer
- Only schedules if user is authenticated and needs backup
- Sets 15-second timeout before triggering backup
- Prevents backup during active backup operation

**Reactive Effect:**

```typescript
$effect(() => {
	if (needsBackup) {
		scheduleAutoBackup();
	}
});
```

**Cleanup:**

- `onDestroy()` hook clears timer on component unmount
- Prevents memory leaks
- Timer also cleared on successful manual backup

#### Backup Triggers

Auto-backup is scheduled when:

1. User marks medication as taken
2. User marks medication as skipped
3. User undoes a medication log
4. User edits medication time
5. Any other data modification

#### Smart Timer Management

- **Debouncing**: Each new change resets the 15-second timer
- **Prevents spam**: Multiple rapid changes only trigger one backup
- **Efficient**: Waits for user to finish making changes
- **Non-intrusive**: Runs in background without blocking UI

### User Experience

**Before:**

- Manual backup required
- Easy to forget
- Risk of data loss
- Orange "Not Backed Up" indicator lingered

**After:**

- Automatic backup after 15 seconds
- "Not Backed Up" → "Backed Up" automatically
- Peace of mind for users
- Still allows manual backup anytime
- Works only for authenticated users

### Technical Benefits

1. **Debounced**: Multiple changes within 15 seconds only trigger one backup
2. **Conditional**: Only runs for authenticated users
3. **Safe**: Checks if backup is already in progress
4. **Clean**: Properly cleaned up on unmount
5. **Reactive**: Uses Svelte 5's `$effect()` for reactive scheduling

### Edge Cases Handled

- **Rapid changes**: Timer resets on each change
- **Manual backup**: Cancels auto-backup timer
- **Logout**: Timer cleared on component unmount
- **Already backing up**: Skips scheduling if backup in progress
- **Page refresh**: Uses persisted state, syncs on mount

## Integration Points

### Main Page (+page.svelte)

- Added `onDestroy` import from Svelte
- New `autoBackupTimer` state variable
- `scheduleAutoBackup()` function
- Reactive `$effect()` for auto-scheduling
- Cleanup in `onDestroy()`
- Passes `onMarkTaken` and `onMarkSkipped` to HistoryView

### HistoryView Component

- New props: `onMarkTaken`, `onMarkSkipped`
- Skip dialog state management
- Action buttons for pending medications
- Dialog component for skip notes

### TodayTracker Component

- No changes needed (already had these features)
- HistoryView reuses same callback pattern

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Svelte 5 runes used correctly
- [x] Props passed correctly between components
- [x] No runtime errors
- [x] Callbacks trigger properly

## Feature 3: Edit Time for Past Medications

### Problem Solved

Users could edit the time for today's medications in the TodayTracker, but had no way to edit the time for medications taken on previous days if they needed to correct the time.

### Solution

Added "Edit Time" button for taken medications in the History view, allowing users to modify both the date and time when a medication was taken.

### Implementation Details

**New State Variables:**

```typescript
let showEditTimeDialog = $state(false);
let editTimeLog = $state<MedicationLog | null>(null);
let editedTime = $state('');
let editedDate = $state('');
```

**New Functions:**

- `openEditTimeDialog(log)`: Opens dialog with current date/time pre-filled
- `saveEditedTime()`: Updates the log with new date/time

**UI Components:**

- Edit Time button appears next to Undo button for taken medications
- Dialog with date picker and time picker inputs
- Pre-fills with current actualTime or scheduledTime
- Validates and saves to ISO string format

**User Experience:**

- Click "Edit Time" button on any taken medication
- Modify date using date picker (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Modify time using time picker (HH:MM)
- Save to update the log
- Triggers auto-backup after 15 seconds

### Use Cases

1. **Correct logging errors**: User logged wrong time, can now fix it
2. **Retroactive accuracy**: Adjust time for past days to reflect reality
3. **Timezone corrections**: Fix times after traveling
4. **Late logging**: Mark medication as taken and set the correct past time

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable timer**: Allow users to set auto-backup delay (5, 15, 30 seconds)
2. **Backup indicator**: Show countdown or progress in UI
3. **Offline queue**: Queue changes when offline, sync when back online
4. **Conflict resolution**: Handle conflicts when syncing across devices
5. **Backup history**: Show last backup time
6. **Manual disable**: Option to disable auto-backup for power users
7. **Bulk edit**: Edit times for multiple medications at once
8. **Time suggestions**: Suggest typical times based on past behavior

## Implementation Notes

### Svelte 5 Patterns Used

- `$state()` for reactive variables
- `$effect()` for side effects (auto-backup scheduling)
- `$props()` for component props
- `onDestroy()` for cleanup
- Proper callback pattern for parent-child communication

### Performance Considerations

- Debounced backup prevents unnecessary server calls
- Timer cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Conditional logic prevents redundant operations
- Lightweight components with minimal re-renders

### Accessibility

- Dialog component is keyboard accessible
- Buttons have proper labels and icons
- Screen reader friendly
- Consistent with existing UI patterns
